SMP can reduce visibility by 50-80% depending on scar width (under 3mm works best), color contrast, and elevation. The key is managing expectations: SMP creates a visual distraction by adding pigment around and within the scar, making it less obvious but not completely invisible, especially under bright lighting or touch."

        <h2>Types of Scars SMP Can Camouflage</h2>
        <p>Scalp Micropigmentation is a highly effective solution for reducing the visibility of various types of scalp scars. While not every scar can be completely hidden, SMP can dramatically improve appearance and restore confidence. Here are the most common scar types we treat:</p>

        <h3>Hair Transplant Scars (FUE & FUT)</h3>
        <p>The most common scars we treat are from hair transplant surgeries. <strong>FUE (Follicular Unit Extraction)</strong> leaves hundreds of tiny, round scars (0.8-1mm) across the donor area (back and sides of the head). <strong>FUT (Follicular Unit Transplantation)</strong>, also called strip method, creates a linear scar running horizontally across the back of the head, typically 15-30cm long and 1-5mm wide.</p>
        <p>Both types respond well to SMP, though FUE scars are generally easier to camouflage due to their smaller size and distributed pattern.</p>

        <h3>Surgical & Injury Scars</h3>
        <p>Scars from accidents, burns, surgeries, or medical procedures can be successfully camouflaged if they're located on the scalp and have fully healed. Common examples include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Accident or trauma scars (cuts, lacerations, burns)</li>
          <li>Craniotomy or brain surgery scars</li>
          <li>Mole or cyst removal scars</li>
          <li>Birthmarks or congenital scars</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Scars That May Not Be Suitable</h3>
        <p>Some scars are not ideal candidates for SMP camouflage:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Keloid scars:</strong> Raised, overgrown scars that may worsen with pigmentation</li>
          <li><strong>Active/healing scars:</strong> Scars less than 6-12 months old still undergoing color and texture changes</li>
          <li><strong>Hypertrophic scars:</strong> Significantly elevated scars that may not retain pigment</li>
          <li><strong>Infected or inflamed areas:</strong> Any scar with active skin issues must heal completely first</li>
        </ul>

      </section>

      <section id="fue-scars" class="guide-section">
        <h2>FUE Scar Camouflage</h2>
        <p>FUE hair transplants extract individual follicles, leaving hundreds or thousands of small, circular scars across the donor area. While less visible than FUT scars, FUE scars can become noticeable when you shave your head or keep hair very short.</p>

        <h3>How FUE Scars Form</h3>
        <p>During FUE, a 0.8-1mm punch tool extracts follicles one by one. Each extraction site heals as a small, white or pale scar. When hair grows over these scars, they're invisible. But if you shave your head or keep hair under 3-4mm, the white dots become visible—often described as a "polka dot" or "moth-eaten" appearance.</p>

        <h3>SMP Camouflage Strategy for FUE</h3>
        <p>The goal of FUE scar camouflage is to darken each white dot so it blends with surrounding skin and simulated hair follicles. Here's our approach:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Map the donor area:</strong> Identify all visible FUE scars, noting density and distribution.</li>
          <li><strong>Match skin tone:</strong> Custom-mix pigment to match your natural scalp color (not the white scar tissue).</li>
          <li><strong>Pigment each scar:</strong> Apply SMP dots within and around each FUE scar to break up the white color contrast.</li>
          <li><strong>Blend with full/partial SMP:</strong> If you're also getting hairline or density SMP, we integrate scar camouflage into the overall pattern for a cohesive look.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Expected Results</h3>
        <p>Most clients see 70-90% visibility reduction of FUE scars after 2-3 sessions. Small, well-healed scars (under 1mm) often become nearly invisible. Larger scars (1-1.5mm) will still be detectable under very close inspection but blend seamlessly from normal viewing distances (3+ feet).</p>
      </section>

      <section id="fut-scars" class="guide-section">
        <h2>FUT Strip Scar Camouflage</h2>
        <p>FUT (strip method) hair transplants leave a linear scar across the back of the head where a strip of scalp was removed and the incision sutured closed. FUT scars are more challenging to camouflage than FUE scars due to their length, width, and raised texture.</p>

        <h3>Why FUT Scars Are Challenging</h3>
        <p>FUT scars present three main obstacles:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Width variation:</strong> Scars range from 1-5mm wide, with wider scars being harder to camouflage.</li>
          <li><strong>Elevation:</strong> Many FUT scars are raised or depressed, creating shadow lines that pigment alone can't fully hide.</li>
          <li><strong>Color contrast:</strong> Scars often appear white, pink, or shiny, creating strong contrast against normal skin.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>SMP Camouflage Strategy for FUT</h3>
        <p>FUT camouflage requires a multi-layered approach:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Scar assessment:</strong> Measure scar width, elevation, color, and texture to determine feasibility and set realistic expectations.</li>
          <li><strong>Base layer pigmentation:</strong> Apply pigment directly into the scar tissue to darken it toward surrounding skin tone.</li>
          <li><strong>Follicle simulation:</strong> Add simulated hair follicles within and around the scar to create a textured, natural appearance.</li>
          <li><strong>Edge blending:</strong> Feather the edges of the scar with graduated pigment density to eliminate hard lines.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Expected Results</h3>
        <p>FUT scars can typically be reduced in visibility by 50-80%, depending on scar characteristics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Best results (70-80% reduction):</strong> Thin scars (under 2mm), minimal elevation, good skin elasticity</li>
          <li><strong>Moderate results (50-70% reduction):</strong> Wider scars (2-4mm), some elevation, moderate color contrast</li>
          <li><strong>Limited results (30-50% reduction):</strong> Very wide scars (4mm+), significant elevation or depression, shiny/stretched tissue</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Important:</strong> FUT scars rarely become "invisible." The goal is to make them significantly less noticeable, especially from normal viewing distances and social interaction ranges.</p>

        <h2>Scar Assessment & Candidacy</h2>
        <p>Not every scar is a good candidate for SMP camouflage. During your free consultation, Stella will assess your scar using these criteria:</p>

        <table class="pricing-table">

      <section id="technique" class="guide-section">
        <h2>How SMP Camouflage Works</h2>
        <p>Scar camouflage SMP uses specialized techniques that differ from standard scalp density treatments. Understanding the process helps set realistic expectations.</p>

        <h3>Pigment Selection & Customization</h3>
        <p>Scar tissue absorbs and displays pigment differently than healthy skin. We custom-mix pigments to account for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Skin undertones:</strong> Warm, cool, or neutral undertones affect how pigment appears once healed.</li>
          <li><strong>Scar color:</strong> White scars require darker pigment; red/pink scars need cooling tones.</li>
          <li><strong>Surrounding skin:</strong> Pigment must match not just hair color but the scalp's natural tone under shaved conditions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Needle Depth & Pressure Adjustments</h3>
        <p>Scar tissue is denser and less vascular than normal skin, requiring adjusted needle technique:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Deeper penetration:</strong> Scar tissue may need slightly deeper pigment placement for retention.</li>
          <li><strong>Varied pressure:</strong> Hard scars require more pressure; soft scars need gentler application.</li>
          <li><strong>Multiple passes:</strong> Scars often need 2-3 passes over the same area to achieve adequate color saturation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Layered Application</h3>
        <p>We build scar camouflage in layers across multiple sessions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Session 1 (Base layer):</strong> Apply foundational pigment to assess how the scar holds color and identify areas needing extra attention.</li>
          <li><strong>Session 2 (Density build):</strong> Add follicle simulation and increase pigment density where needed.</li>
          <li><strong>Session 3+ (Refinement):</strong> Fine-tune color matching, blend edges, and fill any sparse spots.</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section id="expectations" class="guide-section">
        <h2>Managing Expectations</h2>
        <p>Scar camouflage is one of the most nuanced applications of SMP. Setting realistic expectations is critical to satisfaction. Here's what to expect:</p>
        

        <h3>What SMP Can Do</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dramatically reduce visibility:</strong> Make scars 50-90% less noticeable depending on scar type and severity.</li>
          <li><strong>Blend scars with surrounding areas:</strong> Create visual continuity so scars don't immediately draw attention.</li>
          <li><strong>Restore confidence:</strong> Allow you to wear short hairstyles or shave your head without self-consciousness.</li>
          <li><strong>Improve texture appearance:</strong> Simulated follicles create a textured look that distracts from smooth scar tissue.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What SMP Cannot Do</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Remove scars:</strong> Scars remain physically present; SMP creates optical camouflage, not scar removal.</li>
          <li><strong>Fix severe elevation:</strong> Deeply raised or depressed scars will still have texture differences under certain lighting.</li>
          <li><strong>Guarantee perfect invisibility:</strong> Very wide, shiny, or stretched scars may still be detectable under close inspection.</li>
          <li><strong>Last forever:</strong> Scar tissue fades pigment faster (3-4 years vs. 5-6 for normal skin), requiring more frequent touch-ups.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Factors Affecting Results</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Viewing distance:</strong> Scars that are noticeable at 6 inches may be invisible at 3 feet.</li>
          <li><strong>Lighting conditions:</strong> Bright overhead lighting highlights scars more than diffused or natural lighting.</li>
          <li><strong>Hair length:</strong> Keeping hair at 1-2mm (freshly shaved) shows best results; longer hair may expose scar texture.</li>
          <li><strong>Skin tone:</strong> Darker skin tones often see better camouflage due to less color contrast between scars and normal skin.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Sessions, Timeline & Healing</h2>
        <p>Scar camouflage typically requires 2-4 sessions spaced 4-6 weeks apart, depending on scar size, severity, and skin response.</p>

        <h3>Session Breakdown</h3>

        <h4>Session 1: Foundation (1-2 hours)</h4>
        <p>The first session tests how your scar tissue accepts and displays pigment. We apply a conservative base layer, intentionally going lighter than the final goal. This allows us to assess pigment retention, color accuracy, and any adverse reactions before committing to full density.</p>

        <h4>Session 2: Density Build (1-2 hours)</h4>
        <p>After 4-6 weeks of healing, we evaluate session 1 results and add density. This session darkens the color, fills gaps, and begins the follicle simulation pattern. Most clients see significant improvement after session 2.</p>

        <h4>Session 3+: Refinement (1-2 hours)</h4>
        <p>Additional sessions refine color matching, add finishing touches, and address any areas that need extra attention. Larger or more complex scars (like wide FUT scars) may need 3-4 sessions total.</p>

        <h3>Healing Timeline</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Days 1-4:</strong> Redness, slight swelling, and darkened pigment appearance. Keep area dry and avoid touching.</li>
          <li><strong>Days 5-10:</strong> Light scabbing and flaking. Pigment appears 40-50% lighter than initial application—this is temporary.</li>
          <li><strong>Days 11-30:</strong> Scabs fully shed. Pigment continues to lighten as skin regenerates, settling at final color by day 30.</li>
          <li><strong>Weeks 4-6:</strong> Pigment stabilizes. Ready for next session.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Pain Level</h3>
        <p>Most clients rate scar SMP at 2-4 out of 10 on the pain scale. Scar tissue often has reduced sensation compared to healthy skin, making treatment more comfortable. Some hypersensitive scars may feel tender, but topical numbing cream makes the process very manageable.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can SMP completely hide FUE scars?</h3>
          <p>SMP can dramatically reduce the visibility of FUE scars by 70-90%, but "complete" hiding depends on scar severity, skin tone, and head shaving frequency. Small, well-healed FUE scars (under 1mm) typically become nearly invisible with proper SMP. Larger or more prominent scars may still be detectable under close inspection but will blend seamlessly from normal viewing distances.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How effective is SMP for FUT strip scars?</h3>
          <p>FUT strip scars are among the most challenging to camouflage because of their linear, raised nature. SMP can reduce visibility by 50-80% depending on scar width (under 3mm works best), color contrast, and elevation. The key is managing expectations: SMP creates a visual distraction by adding pigment around and within the scar, making it less obvious but not completely invisible, especially under bright lighting or touch.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Will SMP work on raised or keloid scars?</h3>
          <p>SMP can be applied to raised scars, but results vary. Flat or minimally raised scars respond best. Keloid scars or significantly elevated scars may not hold pigment well and carry higher risks of further scarring. We assess each scar individually during consultation and may recommend scar revision surgery first if elevation is too pronounced.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How long must I wait after surgery before getting SMP?</h3>
          <p>For hair transplants (FUE/FUT), wait at least 12 months before SMP to ensure complete healing and final scar maturation. For injury or surgical scars, wait a minimum of 6-12 months depending on scar type and healing progression. Premature SMP can cause pigment rejection, poor retention, or additional scarring.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Does SMP hurt more on scar tissue?</h3>
          <p>Scar tissue often has less sensation than normal skin, so many clients find SMP on scars less painful than on healthy scalp. However, some scars are hypersensitive, especially newer ones. We use topical numbing cream and adjust needle pressure based on your feedback. Most clients rate scar SMP at 2-4 out of 10 on the pain scale.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Will the pigment fade faster on scars?</h3>
          <p>Yes, scar tissue has altered blood flow and skin structure, which can cause faster fading—typically 30-40% faster than normal scalp. Most scar SMP requires touch-ups every 3-4 years versus 5-6 years for standard SMP. Sun exposure, scar thickness, and skin type all affect longevity. We build in extra density during initial sessions to compensate.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can SMP camouflage white or discolored scars?</h3>
          <p>Yes, SMP is particularly effective for white or hypopigmented scars because the dark pigment creates strong contrast against the pale scar tissue. The goal is to darken the scar to match surrounding skin tone, then add follicle simulation to blend it seamlessly. Very red or hyperpigmented scars may need more sessions to achieve balance.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How many sessions are needed for scar camouflage?</h3>
          <p>Most scar camouflage requires 2-4 sessions depending on scar size, severity, and skin response. FUE scars (multiple small dots) typically need 2-3 sessions. FUT strip scars often require 3-4 sessions to build adequate coverage. Each session is spaced 4-6 weeks apart to allow healing and assess pigment retention.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What if I have both scars and hair loss?</h3>
          <p>Many clients combine scar camouflage with full or partial scalp SMP to address both concerns simultaneously. This creates a cohesive look where scars blend into the overall density pattern. Pricing typically reflects combined treatment areas, and we sequence sessions to optimize healing and pigment matching across all zones.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How much does scar camouflage SMP cost in Canada?</h3>
          <p>At Stella's Ink Chamber, scar camouflage pricing depends on scar size and complexity. Small FUE scars (donor area, under 50 dots) start at $600-$1,000. FUT strip scars range from $800-$1,800 depending on length and width. Larger or multiple scars may cost $1,500-$2,500. Free consultations include detailed quotes based on your specific scar assessment.</p>
