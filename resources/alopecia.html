      <section id="types-of-alopecia" class="guide-section">
        <h2>Types of Alopecia & How SMP Helps</h2>
        <p>Alopecia affects over 2% of Canadians at some point in their lives, causing unpredictable hair loss that ranges from small patches to complete baldness. Scalp Micropigmentation offers a non-invasive, permanent solution for multiple types of alopecia:</p>

        <h3>Alopecia Areata (AA)</h3>
        <p>Alopecia areata causes round, smooth patches of hair loss, typically on the scalp but sometimes on eyebrows or beard areas. SMP works exceptionally well for stable AA patches by creating the illusion of short, dense hair follicles. The key requirement: patches must be inactive (no new growth or loss) for at least 6 months before treatment.</p>
        <p>SMP can blend the edges of patches with surrounding hair, making them virtually undetectable when you keep your hair short (under 1 inch). For those who prefer to keep longer hair, SMP adds baseline density that reduces the stark contrast between bald patches and surrounding hair.</p>

        <h3>Alopecia Totalis (AT) & Universalis (AU)</h3>
        <p>Alopecia totalis (complete scalp hair loss) and universalis (complete body hair loss) are ideal candidates for full-scalp SMP. The result is a natural-looking shaved head appearance—think Jason Statham or The Rock. Many clients find this "buzz cut" look empowering and liberating, eliminating the need for wigs, hats, or constant worry about bald spots showing.</p>
        <p>Full-scalp SMP typically requires 3-4 sessions to build optimal density and achieve consistent color across the entire scalp. The treatment creates uniform coverage with no visible patchiness or uneven fading.</p>

          <figcaption class="image-caption">SMP creates natural-looking density for alopecia patients, restoring confidence and eliminating the need for wigs or head coverings.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Traction Alopecia</h3>
        <p>Traction alopecia results from years of tight hairstyles—braids, ponytails, extensions, or weaves—causing permanent damage to hair follicles along the hairline and temples. This type of hair loss is particularly common among women and affects an estimated 30-50% of women who regularly wear tight styles.</p>
        <p>SMP restores thinned edges and receded hairlines by filling in sparse areas with realistic pigment dots. The treatment works best once you've stopped the damaging styling practices, as continued tension will cause further recession even after SMP.</p>

        <h3>What SMP Can't Do</h3>
        <p>It's important to understand SMP's limitations for alopecia:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Won't stop hair loss:</strong> SMP is cosmetic, not medical. It doesn't treat the underlying autoimmune condition or prevent future flare-ups.</li>
          <li><strong>Won't look natural with long hair:</strong> SMP replicates shaved hair follicles, not long flowing hair. If you keep hair longer than 1-2 inches, SMP may look like dots rather than natural follicles.</li>
          <li><strong>Requires stable hair loss:</strong> Active, changing patches aren't ideal candidates, as the SMP may not match future hair loss patterns.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="blending-strategy" class="guide-section">
        <h2>Blending Strategies for Patches</h2>
        <p>Successfully camouflaging alopecia patches requires careful blending techniques that consider your existing hair color, density, and growth patterns. Here's how Stella approaches patch blending:</p>

        <h3>Edge Feathering</h3>
        <p>Rather than creating a hard line between treated and untreated areas, we feather the edges by gradually decreasing dot density and spacing. This creates a soft transition that mimics how natural hair thins at the edges of growth areas.</p>

        <h3>Color Matching</h3>
        <p>We custom-mix pigments to match your natural hair color at the root level (not the ends, which can be lighter or color-treated). During your consultation, we test multiple shades on your skin to find the perfect match under different lighting conditions—natural daylight, indoor lighting, and bathroom fluorescents.</p>
        <p>For those with salt-and-pepper or graying hair, we blend multiple pigment tones to replicate the natural color variation rather than using a single flat shade.</p>

        <h3>Density Calibration</h3>
        <p>The treated patch must match the density of surrounding hair. Too dense, and it looks like a filled-in tattoo; too sparse, and it fails to camouflage the baldness. We calibrate density by analyzing the follicle count per square centimeter in your surrounding hair zones and replicating that pattern.</p>

        <h3>Hairline Integration</h3>
        <p>If alopecia patches extend to your hairline (common with traction alopecia), we recreate a natural hairline shape with intentional irregularity—no perfectly straight lines or symmetrical curves. A realistic hairline has subtle asymmetry, baby hairs (via lighter pigment dots), and natural recession at the temples.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="candidacy" class="guide-section">
        <h2>Who Is a Good Candidate?</h2>
        <p>Not every alopecia patient is an ideal SMP candidate immediately. Here's a candidacy snapshot to help you determine if you're ready:</p>

      <section id="flare-management" class="guide-section">
        <h2>Managing Active Flare-Ups</h2>
        <p>If you're experiencing active alopecia flare-ups—new patches appearing or existing patches expanding—it's best to postpone SMP until your condition stabilizes. Here's why timing matters:</p>

        <h3>Why Wait for Stability</h3>
        <p><strong>Pattern uncertainty:</strong> Active alopecia means your hair loss pattern is still evolving. If you get SMP on current patches and new patches appear elsewhere, you'll have uneven coverage requiring additional sessions.</p>
        <p><strong>Pigment waste:</strong> If hair regrows in a treated patch after SMP, the pigment remains visible beneath the regrown hair. While this doesn't prevent regrowth, it can create a shadowy appearance if regrowth is sparse.</p>
        <p><strong>Skin sensitivity:</strong> Active flare-ups often involve inflammation and immune activity in the scalp, increasing the risk of poor pigment retention or adverse healing.</p>

        <h3>Working with Your Dermatologist</h3>
        <p>We recommend working closely with your dermatologist to stabilize alopecia before pursuing SMP. Common stabilization strategies include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Topical corticosteroids:</strong> Reduce inflammation and halt patch expansion (discontinue 2 weeks before SMP)</li>
          <li><strong>JAK inhibitors:</strong> Newer medications that suppress immune attacks on hair follicles</li>
          <li><strong>Observation period:</strong> Sometimes the best approach is simply waiting 6-12 months to see if patches stabilize naturally</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once your dermatologist confirms stability, we can proceed with SMP planning. Many clients use this waiting period to research SMP artists, review portfolios, and save for treatment—making the timeline productive rather than frustrating.</p>

      </section>

      <section id="sessions-timeline" class="guide-section">
        <h2>Sessions, Timeline & Pain</h2>
        <p>Most alopecia SMP treatments require 2-3 sessions (full-scalp AT/AU may require 3-4 sessions) spaced 4-6 weeks apart. Here's what to expect at each stage:</p>

        <h3>Session 1: Foundation Layer (2-3 hours)</h3>
        <p>The first session establishes the baseline pattern, hairline shape (if applicable), and initial color match. We intentionally go lighter and less dense than the final goal to allow for adjustments based on how your skin holds pigment. Expect to leave with visible dots that look slightly faded or uneven—this is normal and intentional.</p>

        <h3>Session 2: Density Build (2-3 hours)</h3>
        <p>After 4-6 weeks of healing, we assess pigment retention and add density. This session darkens the color, fills in gaps, and refines the overall appearance. Most clients see a dramatic transformation after session 2, with results looking 70-80% complete.</p>

        <h3>Session 3: Refinement & Perfection (1-2 hours)</h3>
        <p>The final session adds finishing touches—extra density in sparse spots, color correction, and edge refinement. After this session, results should look completely natural and consistent.</p>

        <h3>Pain Level</h3>
        <p>Most clients rate SMP pain at 3-5 out of 10—less painful than a traditional tattoo but more uncomfortable than eyebrow microblading. Alopecia-affected scalps aren't necessarily more sensitive, though areas with active inflammation may be tender.</p>
        <p>We use topical numbing cream and take breaks as needed. The crown and hairline areas tend to be most sensitive. Many clients describe the sensation as light scratching or vibration rather than sharp pain.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="aftercare" class="guide-section">
        <h2>Aftercare for Alopecia Skin</h2>
        <p>Proper aftercare is critical for optimal healing and pigment retention, especially for alopecia patients who may have more sensitive or reactive skin. Follow these guidelines for the first 10-14 days post-treatment:</p>

        <h3>Days 1-4: Critical Healing Window</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No water contact:</strong> Avoid getting the scalp wet for the first 4 days. No showers on the scalp, swimming, sweating, or rain exposure.</li>
          <li><strong>Gentle cleaning:</strong> After day 4, gently rinse with lukewarm water (no shampoo) and pat dry with a clean towel—no rubbing.</li>
          <li><strong>No touching:</strong> Keep your hands off the treated area to prevent infection and pigment disturbance.</li>
          <li><strong>Sleep elevated:</strong> Use an extra pillow to keep your head elevated and reduce swelling.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Days 5-10: Scabbing & Peeling</h3>
        <p>Small scabs will form and naturally flake off. Do not pick or scratch them, as this can pull out pigment and create patchy results. Let them fall off naturally during gentle washing. The scalp may feel itchy—resist the urge to scratch.</p>

        <h3>Days 11-14: Final Healing</h3>
        <p>Once all scabs have fallen off, you can resume normal hair care (if you have hair). Avoid harsh shampoos with sulfates or exfoliating ingredients for the first month. The pigment will appear 30-40% lighter than the final result due to skin regeneration—this is temporary and will darken over the next 4-6 weeks.</p>

        <h3>Long-Term Maintenance</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sun protection:</strong> Apply SPF 30+ to your scalp daily or wear a hat. UV exposure is the #1 cause of premature SMP fading.</li>
          <li><strong>Gentle products:</strong> Use sulfate-free shampoos and avoid chemical exfoliants (AHAs, BHAs) directly on the scalp.</li>
          <li><strong>Moisturize:</strong> Keep your scalp hydrated with non-comedogenic moisturizers to prevent dryness and flaking.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can SMP work for alopecia areata patches?</h3>
          <p>Yes, SMP is highly effective for stable alopecia areata patches. If your patches have been inactive for 6+ months and show no signs of new hair loss or regrowth, SMP can create the appearance of density. However, if patches are still actively changing, it's best to wait until they stabilize to ensure optimal results.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Is SMP suitable for alopecia totalis or universalis?</h3>
          <p>Yes, SMP works beautifully for alopecia totalis (complete scalp hair loss) and universalis (complete body hair loss). The full-scalp shaved look is one of SMP's strongest applications, creating a natural-looking buzz cut appearance. Many clients with total hair loss find SMP gives them confidence and eliminates the need for wigs or head coverings.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What if my alopecia patches start regrowing hair after SMP?</h3>
          <p>If hair regrows through the SMP-treated area, it will simply grow over the pigment dots. You can let it grow naturally or keep the area shaved. The pigment won't interfere with regrowth. If you experience significant regrowth and want to remove the SMP, laser removal is possible, though most clients choose to maintain the shaved look even if partial regrowth occurs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How does SMP handle traction alopecia?</h3>
          <p>SMP is excellent for traction alopecia, especially along the hairline and temples where tight hairstyles cause damage. It can fill in thinned edges and restore a natural-looking hairline. The key is ensuring you've stopped the damaging hair practices before getting SMP, so the hair loss doesn't continue to progress.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Does SMP hurt more on alopecia-affected skin?</h3>
          <p>Alopecia-affected skin isn't necessarily more sensitive, but everyone's pain tolerance varies. Most clients rate SMP at 3-5 out of 10 on the pain scale—similar to eyebrow threading or light scratching. We use topical numbing cream and take breaks as needed. The crown and hairline areas tend to be most sensitive, but treatments are very manageable.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can SMP trigger new alopecia flare-ups?</h3>
          <p>There's no evidence that SMP triggers alopecia flare-ups. However, we recommend waiting until your alopecia has been stable for at least 6 months before treatment. If you have active, rapidly changing patches, it's best to work with your dermatologist first to stabilize the condition, then proceed with SMP once the hair loss has plateaued.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How long does SMP last for alopecia patients?</h3>
          <p>SMP typically lasts 4-6 years before noticeable fading occurs. Factors like sun exposure, skin type, and aftercare affect longevity. Most clients need a touch-up session every 4-5 years to refresh the color and maintain crispness. Full-scalp SMP tends to fade more evenly than partial treatments, making maintenance straightforward.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What if I have sensitive skin from alopecia treatments?</h3>
          <p>If you've been using topical treatments like corticosteroids or JAK inhibitors, discontinue them 2 weeks before SMP to allow your skin to normalize. Let us know about any skin sensitivities during your consultation so we can adjust needle depth and numbing protocols. We work with many alopecia patients who have reactive skin and tailor treatments accordingly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can I get SMP if I'm still trying regrowth treatments?</h3>
          <p>It's best to pause regrowth treatments during the SMP healing phase (first 10-14 days) to avoid irritation and infection risk. After healing, you can resume most topicals. However, if you're actively pursuing aggressive regrowth protocols, it may be wise to wait until you've decided on your long-term hair strategy to avoid unnecessary SMP if significant regrowth occurs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How much does SMP cost for alopecia patients in Canada?</h3>
          <p>At Stella's Ink Chamber, pricing depends on treatment area size. Small patches (under 3 inches) start around $800-$1,200. Larger areas or full-scalp SMP range from $2,500-$4,000. Most alopecia treatments require 2-3 sessions spaced 4-6 weeks apart. We provide detailed quotes during free consultations based on your specific pattern and goals.</p>
