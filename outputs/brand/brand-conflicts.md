# Brand Token Conflicts Report

## Scan Date: 2024-12-19

## Sources Analyzed
- Live site scan: `https://stellasinkchamber.com/`
- Local repository: `public/stella/styles.css`, `index.html`, `public/stella/app.js`

## Conflicts Found: None

### Analysis Summary
The brand tokens extracted from both sources were consistent with no conflicts detected:

1. **Color Palette**: Both sources used the same primary color (#293919) and supporting grays
2. **Typography**: Consistent font families (Source Sans Pro for body, Libre Baskerville for headings)
3. **Spacing Scale**: Identical spacing values (0.25rem to 4rem)
4. **Border Radius**: Consistent radius values (0.25rem to 0.75rem)
5. **Button Styles**: Matching button specifications and hover states
6. **Shadow Values**: Consistent shadow definitions across components

### Resolution Strategy
Since no conflicts were found, the merged brand tokens file (`stella-brand-tokens.json`) uses values from both sources without modification. The local repository styles were used as the primary source for detailed component specifications, while the live site scan provided validation of the actual implementation.

### Recommendations
- Continue using the established color palette and typography
- Maintain consistency with existing button and card styles
- Ensure all new components follow the established design patterns
- Use the brand tokens file as the single source of truth for all styling decisions

### Next Steps
1. Implement BrandGuard utility to enforce token usage
2. Create brand component library based on these tokens
3. Apply tokens to the Instant Quote calculator
4. Set up visual regression testing to maintain consistency
